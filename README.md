# Gesture recognition program
This program uses mmWave radar to collect RDI map and CNN+LSTM structure to recognize inputed data is which gesture.
## 1. Data collection
I recorded two gestures: "pipi" and "swipe left" using mmWave radar.
## 2. Data preprocessing
1. Normalizing the RDI map data to a range of 0-1. 
2. Transfroming labels to 0/1.

## 3. Model training

## 4. Model testing
